# CustomSwitch
A Customizable Switch for the Storyboard.
The switch prevents being pressed during the one second action of flipping itself.
The switch inherites directly from UIView, so you can still manipulate it on your own how you see fit.
Feel free to submit issues for requests if you want me to add any features!
